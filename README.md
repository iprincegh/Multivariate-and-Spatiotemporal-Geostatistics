Exercises
1. Re-run the co-kriging of the Meuse data set. Interpolate the variables separately (without crossvariograms) and compare the generated maps pre variable.
2. From the hourly time series in no2.st, compute daily mean concentrations using aggregate, and compute the spatiotemporal variogram of this. How does it compare to the variogram of hourly values?
3. Fit different spatiotemporal variogram models and choose the “best fit”.
4. Carry out a spatiotemporal interpolation for daily mean values for the days corresponding to those in the lecture, and compare the results.
